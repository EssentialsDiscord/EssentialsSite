            &quot;Services&quot;). This Agreement is legally binding between you (&quot;User&quot;, &quot;you&quot; or
            &quot;your&quot;) and this Website operator (&quot;Operator&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; or

        <h2>Intellectual property rights</h2>
        <p>&quot;Intellectual Property Rights&quot; means all present and future rights conferred by statute, common law

            equivalent rights or forms of protection and any other results of intellectual activity which subsist or
            will subsist now or in the future in any part of the world. This Agreement does not transfer to you any
            intellectual property owned by the Operator or third parties, and all rights, titles, and interests in and
            to such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with the Operator. All trademarks, service
            marks, graphics and logos used in connection with the Website and Services, are trademarks or registered
            trademarks of the Operator or its licensors. Other trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in
            connection with the Website and Services may be the trademarks of other third parties. Your use of the
            Website and Services grants you no right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any of the Operator or
            third party trademarks.</p>
        <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will the Operator, its affiliates, directors,
            officers, employees, agents, suppliers or licensors be liable to any person for any indirect, incidental,
            special, punitive, cover or consequential damages (including, without limitation, damages for lost profits,
            revenue, sales, goodwill, use of content, impact on business, business interruption, loss of anticipated
            savings, loss of business opportunity) however caused, under any theory of liability, including, without
            limitation, contract, tort, warranty, breach of statutory duty, negligence or otherwise, even if the liable
            party has been advised as to the possibility of such damages or could have foreseen such damages. To the
            maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the aggregate liability of the Operator and its affiliates,
            officers, employees, agents, suppliers and licensors relating to the services will be limited to an amount
            greater of one dollar or any amounts actually paid in cash by you to the Operator for the prior one month
            period prior to the first event or occurrence giving rise to such liability. The limitations and exclusions
            also apply if this remedy does not fully compensate you for any losses or fails of its essential purpose.
        </p>
        <h2>Dispute resolution</h2>
